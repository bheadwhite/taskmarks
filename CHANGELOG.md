# Changelog
All notable changes to the "taskmarks" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.5.1] - 2018-03-26
### Copy to Clipboard and Paste from Clipboard added

## [Unreleased - Ideas]
- remove all unnecessary ' | undefined' that tslint wanted
- enable debLog by vscode settings (logname and path, blacklist)
- copy Task to clipboard / insert new Task from clipboard (makes sharing some bookmarks much easier)
- find better shortcuts and make them work outside the edit mode (eg 'goto next' should work always)
- add debug points to task (toggle, switch all on or off)
- work on next? first time next at end of file goes back to beginning
- perhaps? be able to leave comments on tasks - for starters, just keep them in taskmarks.json
