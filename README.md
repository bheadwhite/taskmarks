# Taskmarks
VSCode Extension - Persist bookmarks for different tasks.
On big projects, coming back to a topic that I did not touch for some time, I often need time to 'find the right places'. Taskmarks makes it possible to keep those old bookmarks, and go back to them, whenever I need them.
New topic - just add a new Task and keep them forever.

## Features / Command / Keyboard

### Available commands

* **Taskmarks: Create new Task** Create new Task (enter new Taskname)
* **Taskmarks: Select Bookmark From List** List all bookmarks in the current task

## Installing your Extension Locally
So far, we need to copy it to a new folder under your local extensions folder:

- Windows: %USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions
- Mac/Linux: $HOME/.vscode/extensions

See [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/norbertK/taskmarks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)
